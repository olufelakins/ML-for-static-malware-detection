# ML-for-static-malware-detection

This project is an implementation of the thesis " Malware detection using machine learning". The project utilises static malware analysis to develop a malware detection system.
In this implementation, featutres of the Windows Executable are used to create grey scale images which is subsequently used to train a Convolutional Neural Network, Neural Network with Dropout (ReLU activation), and Decision Tree using LightGBM
